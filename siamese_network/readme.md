This folder contains the experiments on using siamese networks to classify similar and dissimilar tree species using data from the IDTrees Dataset.

Contents:

ind_experiments: Contains the individual notebooks with different experiments using the siamese network

siamese_network.py: python file for running the siamese network with manual capability for model tuning

siamese_with_data_augmentation.py: python file for running siamese network with data augmentation, where each image is compared with every other image available in the dataset

optimized_experiment: The optimized files after hyperparameter tuning (*note that this is currently without data-augmentation)
